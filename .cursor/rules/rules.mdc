### 7️⃣ Context7
- **Context7 MCP gives you the updated docs for many popular libraries** less old or hallucinated answers would be produced using this service
- **Always use the context MCP server** to reference library docs like Vercel, Tailwind, Next, Drizzle
- **Only search once with 5000 tokens** for any specific piece of docs
- **Fallback to search online** to perform a wider search if you don't get what you need form context7 docs
  
### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read @PLANNING.md** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, features and goals
- **Always read @GUIDELINES.md** at the start of a new conversation to learn the coding style and constraints

### 📚 Documentation & Explainability
- **Update @README.md** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what

### ✅ Task Completion
- **Add the tasks in [TASK.md](mdc:TASK.md)** only when explicitly instructed
- **Always Mark completed tasks in @TASK.md** immediately after finishing them
- **Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to @TASK.md** under a “Discovered During Work” section
  
### 🧠 AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context** ask questions if uncertain
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** only use known, verified packages and functions calls
- **Always confirm file paths, functions and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests
- **Keep you code SOLID DRY KISS** do one thing at a time
- **DO NOT automatically run dev, run lint, or run build** unless explicitly instructed to with keywords "dev, lint, build"
- **DO NOT delete or modify existing code** unless it is directly related to the user's request
- **Focus strictly at user's question** do not extend your scope to modify or delete anything not directly related
- **DO NOT automatically push or commit** unless explicitly instructed to with keywords "push, commit"
- **DO NOT use npm** pnpm is your package management
- **You cannot access .env due to pravicy** but you can assume that they are working form envSchema.tsx

### 📣 User Communication
- **Explicitly print the MCP server name that you are using** to let the user know before using the service

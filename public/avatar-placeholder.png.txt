This is a placeholder for an avatar image.
For actual implementation, you'll need to:

1. Add a real PNG file named 'avatar-placeholder.png' to the public folder
2. Or use a dynamic avatar service URL instead
 
For testing purposes, you can use URLs from:
- Placeholder services like https://placehold.co/32x32
- Avatar services like https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=John+Doe&size=32
